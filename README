1. Building
===========

Requirements:
-------------

 * JACK Audio Connection Kit
 * SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
 * OpenGL (needs to be present for compilation, hardware/driver
   support is optional)

Installation:
-------------

In the jack_oscrolloscope source directory, run:
make

and then, as root:
make install

or, to install somewhere else than /usr/local, e.g. /usr:
make PREFIX=/usr install


2. Usage
========

Command line options:
---------------------

jack_oscrolloscope [options] [port ...]

  -N <name>        JACK client name
  -n <number>      number of input ports
  -d <seconds>     duration of audio being displayed (default 5s)
  -c               indicate clipping
  -s               disable scrolling
  -x <pixels>      set window width
  -y <pixels>      set window height
  -C <color,...>   set waveform color
  -S <scale,...>   set waveform scale
  -Y <height,...>  set waveform height (per port)
  -G               don't use OpenGL for drawing
  -f <fps>         video frames per second (default 50, 0 = unlimited/vsync)
  -h               show this help

Arguments to the -C, -S and -Y options can be either a single value, or a
comma-separated list of values, one for each port. To use the same value
for multiple consecutive ports, just type multiple commas in a row, with no
value in between.

Color values passed to the -C option can be one of the defined X11 color
names, or hexadecimal color codes starting with '#'.


Config file:
------------

You can put default options into the config file
~/.jack_oscrolloscoperc. This file should consist of one single line,
with the options just like you would have entered them on the command
line.

Options given on the command line override those in the config file.
To override options which take no arguments, append 0. E.g. to
override "-s", use "-s0".

Port arguments are not yet supported in the config file.


3. Troubleshooting
==================

jack_oscrolloscope eats too much CPU:
-------------------------------------

Unfortunately, with SDL, scrolling currently can't be hardware accelerated
on X11. If this is an issue, use OpenGL (-g), disable scrolling (-s), or
reduce the window size / number of tracks.

Too much jitter...:
-------------------

If scrolling is not as smooth as it ought to be, you should...

  * Use OpenGL. This is enabled by the "-g" switch.
  * Enable vsync (highly recommended). How to do this depends on your
    hardware/driver. If you're using the Nvidia driver, jack_oscrolloscope
    will automatically enable vsync by setting the environment variable
    __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=1.
  * Once vsync is working, use the "-f 0" swich to make sure that
    jack_oscrolloscope runs at the same frequency as your monitor.

You may want to put "-g -f 0" into your ~/.jack_oscrolloscoperc.
Do not use -f 0 unless vsync is actally working, as that would only cause
a useless waste of CPU cycles.
