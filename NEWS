2011-01-29: jack_oscrolloscope 0.7

  * OpenGL is now used for drawing by default, but can still be disabled
    using the -G command line option.
  * Added command line options -C, -S and -Y to set color, waveform scaling
    and height on a per-port basis.
  * Worked around possible lock-up problems in cases where drawing can't
    keep up with incoming audio samples.
  * The duration specified with -d can now be a floating point number.
  * Some code cleanup.

2008-09-18: jack_oscrolloscope 0.6

2008-02-07: jack_oscrolloscope 0.5

2007-10-20: jack_oscrolloscope 0.4

  * jack_oscrolloscope is now a lot smarter when it comes to calculating
    appropriate audio buffer sizes depending in samplerate, scrolling speed
    etc.

2007-01-02: jack_oscrolloscope 0.3

  * Once again overhauled OpenGL drawing. It's still not perfect, but at
    least it no longer requires any fancy GL extensions.
  * Some other minor fixes.

2006-11-27: jack_oscrolloscope 0.2

  * Completely revised drawing code for improved performance, in particular
    at large window sizes and with many tracks. For now, a display driver
    supporting the GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension is required to take
    advantage of these changes.

2006-11-19: jack_oscrolloscope 0.1

  * Initial Release.
