2008-02-07: Version 0.5

 * Use jack_client_open() instead of deprecated jack_client_new().
 * Show JACK client name in window title.

2007-10-20: Version 0.4

 * jack_oscrolloscope is now a lot smarter when it comes to calculating
   appropriate audio buffer sizes depending in samplerate, scrolling speed
   etc.

2007-01-02: Version 0.3

 * Once again overhauled OpenGL drawing. It's still not perfect, but at least
   it no longer requires any fancy GL extensions.
 * Some other minor fixes.

2006-11-27: Version 0.2

 * Completely revised drawing code for improved performance, in particular at
   large window sizes and with many tracks. For now, a display driver
   supporting the GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension is required to take
   advantage of these changes.

2006-11-19: Version 0.1

 * Initial Release.
